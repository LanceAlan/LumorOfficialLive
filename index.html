    <p>Lumor is building PRE — a new physical substrate for computation designed to move beyond
    brittle digital stacks and into adaptive, energy-efficient, real-world architectures.

  <h2>Who We Are</h2>
  <p>
    Lumor is an early-stage research company exploring new physical approaches to computation.
    Our work focuses on foundational architectures rather than incremental improvements.

  <h2>What We Are Building</h2>
  <p>
    PRE is our ongoing investigation into a physical computational medium designed for adaptive,
    resilient, real-world systems. The specifics will evolve as the research develops.

  <h2>What We Aim to Achieve</h2>
  <p>
    Our long-term goal is to create computational substrates that operate beyond the limits of
    traditional digital stacks — systems that can adapt, stabilize, and interact with the world
    in fundamentally new ways.

  <h2>Founder</h2>
  <p>
    Lumor was founded by Lance, a systems architect focused on building environments, tools,
    and computational frameworks that enable new forms of intelligence and interaction.
    A full bio will be added as the project matures.
